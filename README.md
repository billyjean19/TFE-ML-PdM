# TFE: ML-PdM

***Context***: The final aim of this project is to build an automated solution capable of predicting future failure modes in washing machines by capturing vibration data using non-intrusive detection modules.

***Scope of this project***: Integration of machine learning classifiers to enable predictive maintenance of washing machines.

***Research question***: Classification of washing machines based on vibration sensor signals: towards predictive maintenance of household appliances
